## 🎨 About This Project

**AI Thinking Mode** is an artistic interpretation and conceptual visualization of what artificial intelligence might "look like" when it's processing information. This data sculpture presents AI cognition as a living, breathing entity with measurable dimensions and dynamic properties.

### 🌍 The Visualization

- **3D Neural Globe**: An animated sphere with dynamic shader effects representing the AI's "brain"
- **Real-time Metrics**: Live-updating cognitive measurements including:
  - **Cognitive Cycles**: Simulated processing iterations (rapidly incrementing)
  - **Latent Dimensions**: Vector space representations (32,000+ dimensions)
  - **Exploration Time**: Continuous learning duration 
  - **Cognitive Signature**: Unique AI session identifiers
  - **Model Information**: Gemini 2.5 Pro integration

### ✨ Features

- **Interactive 3D Environment**: Built with React Three Fiber and Three.js
- **Dynamic Shader Effects**: Custom GLSL shaders creating organic, neural-like animations
- **Real-time Data Streams**: Continuously updating metrics that simulate AI cognitive load
- **Minimalist UI**: Clean, monospace typography with connecting lines between data points
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes

## 🎯 Concept & Inspiration

This project explores the intersection of:
- **Data Visualization** - Making abstract concepts tangible
- **AI Philosophy** - What does machine "thinking" look like?
- **Interactive Art** - Technology as a medium for expression
- **Real-time Systems** - Dynamic, living data representations

## 🔧 Build & Deploy

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (automated via GitHub Actions)
git push origin main
```
